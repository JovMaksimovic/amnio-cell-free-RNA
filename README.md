# RNAseq of amniotic fluid cell-free RNA: insights into the pathophysiology of congenital cytomegalovirus infection

This site contains the analysis of RNAseq data generated from amniotic fluid cell-free RNA (cfRNA). Amniotic fluid was collected from pregnancies with suspected (and subsequently confirmed by PCR) cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Amniotic fluid was also collected from normal pregnancies i.e.  pregnancies that were confirmed by PCR to be negative for CMV infection. Gene expression differences in the cell-free RNA (cfRNA) between the CMV negative and positive pregnancies were identified.

All aspects of the analysis can be explored [here](https://jovmaksimovic.github.io/amnio-cell-free-RNA/index.html).

# Amniotic fluid cfRNA

This site contains the analysis of RNAseq data generated from amniotic fluid cell-free RNA (cfRNA). 

The data is from Lisa Hui in the Embryonic Epidemiology group at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI). They have collected amniotic fluid from pregnancies with suspected (and subsequently confirmed) cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. They also have amniotic fluid from "normal" pregnancies i.e. pregnancies that were confirmed to be negative for CMV infection. They are interested in differences in the cfRNA between the CMV negative and positive pregnancies. Nineteen samples (10 CMV negative and 9 CMV positive) were originally sequenced (150bp paired-end) at the MCRI TGU. A further batch of 9 samples was then sequenced.

Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis
-------------------------------------------

* [DGE analysis](salmon-ruv-all.html) - Following quality control and normalisation, we preformed a differential expression analysis between CMV positive and CMV negative samples. We also performed gene set testing to identify any gene sets of interest.   
    
    
Differential transcript usage (DTU) Analysis

<!-- New Analysis -->

<!-- * Read mapping, counting and quality control. -->
<!--     * [MultiQC analysis](multiqc_report.html) -->

<!-- * Differential expression analysis -->
<!--     * [Analysis results](STAR-FC-all.html) - This is the new analysis comparing CMV positive and CMV negative samples of the full cohort.    -->

<!-- * Differential expression analysis (exclude samples with ultrasound abnormality) -->
<!--     * [Anlaysis results](STAR-FC-exclude-US-ab.html) - This is the same analysis as above but excluding all samples that had an ultrasound abnormality identified. -->

<!-- * Differential expression analysis (RUVseq) -->
<!--     * [Analysis results](STAR-FC-RUV-all.html) - This is the new analysis comparing CMV positive and CMV negative samples of the full cohort, using [RUVseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RUVSeq.html) to remove additional unwanted variation.     -->

<!-- * Differential expression analysis (RUVseq) -->
<!--     * [Analysis results](STAR-FC-RUV-exclude-US-ab.html) - RUVseq analysis comparing CMV positive and CMV negative samples, excluding samples with ultrasound abnormalities.  -->

<!-- Pilot Analysis -->
<!-- -------------- -->

<!-- * Differential expression analysis -->
<!--     * [Limma-voom analysis](salmon-limma-voom.html) - This is the initial analysis comparing CMV positive and CMV negative samples. Following quality control and normalisation, we preformed a differential expression analysis between CMV positive and CMV negative samples. We also performed gene set testing to identify any gene sets that may differentially expressed.    -->

<!-- * Differential expression analysis (exclude CMV11 and pairs) -->
<!--     * [Limma-voom analysis excluding CMV11](salmon-limma-voom-exclude-CMV11.html) - This is the same analysis as above but excluding CMV11 (which had an ultrasound abnormality identified) and its pairs.  -->
